# README #

The file `TopKFI.java` contains the template you can modify to implement your project.

The folder `datasets` contains some examples of small, moderate and large datasets you can use to test your implementation.
To check the correctness of your algorithm, we provide in the folder `outputs` the expected output of your algorithm
on the example datasets, using `K = 15, 150, 1500`.
